#  __Project__ ðŸš§
Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

# __Goals__ ðŸŽ¯

* an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning
* train a linear regression model (baseline)
* avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model

----------------

# __Deliverables__ ðŸ—ƒ

A notebook with:
* visualisations
* captions and interpretations 
* linear regression model on the dataset, that predicts the amount of weekly sales as a function of the other variables
* The performances of the model assessed by using metrics relevant for regression problems
* Interpretred coefficients of the model to identify what features are important for the prediction
* Regularization models (Lasso or Ridge) to reduce overfitting
